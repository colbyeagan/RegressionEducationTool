# RegressionEducationTool

## About
I just made this for fun because I wanted to actually calculate linear regression from scratch to master the linear algebra and understanding of the solution space.  

This is a bare-bones implementation of linear regression and higher order polynomial regression. One can use this tool to generate 2-dimensional scatterplots and plot lines of best fit through them.
